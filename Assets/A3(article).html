            Explained: Why Pak-Bound Ship From China Was Stopped At Mumbai Port
The ship was halted at Mumbai's Nhava Sheva port on January 23. (Representational)


<b>New Delhi:</b> Indian security agencies recently halted a Karachi-bound ship from China on the suspicion that it contained a dual-use consignment - weighing 22,180 kilogrammes - that could be used for Pakistan's nuclear and ballistic missiles programme. Both China and Pakistan have denied that sensitive components were being transferred on the seized ship.
The customs officials, based on an intelligence input, stopped the Malta-flagged merchant ship - CMA CGM Attila - at the Nhava Sheva port on January 23 and inspected the consignment and found a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine, originally manufactured by an Italian company.
<br>

<b>Why Was The Consignment Seized?</b>
<br>


CNC machines are basically controlled by a computer and produce a scale of efficiency, consistency and accuracy not possible manually. These are often used in missiles.
<br>

These machines have been restricted under the Wassenaar Arrangement - an international arms control agreement which restricts the spread of tech which have civil and nuclear applications. India is among the 42 member countries that exchange information on transfers of conventional weapons and dual-use goods and technologies.
<br>

According to experts, the equipment would be useful in manufacturing critical parts for Pakistan's missile development programme.
<br>

A Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) team has inspected the consignment and certified its possible use in Islamabad's nuclear programme.
<br>

The CNC machine was used by North Korea in its nuclear programme.
<br>
<b>
What Does India's Probe Suggest?</b>
<br>

The consignment was seized after port officials with specific intelligence, had alerted the Indian defence authorities who inspected the heavy cargo. Authorites said the seizure falls under the prevention of possible proliferation by Pakistan and China.
<br>

According to documents such as bills of loading and other details of the consignment, the consigner was mentioned as "Shanghai JXE Global Logistics Co Ltd" and the consignee was "Pakistan Wings Pvt Ltd" of Sialkot.
<br>

A deeper investigation by the security agencies indicated that the consignment was shipped by Taiyuan Mining Import and Export Co Ltd and meant for Cosmos Engineering in Pakistan, the officials told PTI.
<br>

This is not the first instance when Indian port officials have seized such dual-use military-grade items being shipped from China to Pakistan.

Cosmos Engineering, a Pakistani defence supplier, has been on a watchlist since March 12, 2022, when Indian authorities intercepted a shipment of Italian-made thermoelectric instruments, once again at the Nhava Sheva port.
<br>


<b>How Have Pakistan And China Reacted?</b>
<br>


China has said that the consignment does not contain military equipment or a dual-use tech and that Beijing has been strictly fulfilling its international non-proliferation obligations while Pakistan has termed the action "India's high handedness".

        <blockquote>
            
               <p> Male, Maldives: Stepping up his anti-India rhetoric, Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has affirmed that no Indian military personnel, not even those in civilian clothing, would be present inside his country after May 10, a media report said today.
                President Muizzu's statement comes less than a week after an Indian civilian team reached the Maldives to take charge of one of the three aviation platforms in the island nation, well ahead of the March 10 deadline agreed by the two nations for the withdrawal of Indian military personnel.
                </p>
Addressing the Baa atoll Eydhafushi residential community during his tour across the atoll, the President stated that due to his government's success in expelling Indian troops from the country, people who spread false rumours, are attempting to twist the situation, a news portal Edition.mv reported.

"That these people [Indian military] are not departing, that they are returning after changing their uniforms into civilian clothing. We must not indulge such thoughts that instil doubts in our hearts and spread lies," the portal quoted Mr Muizzu, widely regarded as a China-backed leader, as saying.
<br>
"There will be no Indian troops in the country come May 10. Not in uniform and not in civilian clothing. The Indian military will not be residing in this country in any form of clothing. I state this with confidence," he said, on a day when his country signed an agreement with China to receive free military aid.
<br>
Earlier last month, after a high-level meeting in Delhi on February 2 between the two sides, the Maldivian foreign ministry said India would replace its military personnel operating the three aviation platforms in the Maldives by May 10 and the first phase of the process would be completed by March 10.
<br>
In his maiden address to Parliament on February 5, he made similar remarks.
<br>
There are 88 military personnel manning the three Indian platforms that have been providing humanitarian and medical evacuation services to the people of the Maldives for the last few years using two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft.
<br>
Mr Muizzu rode to power last year on an anti-India stance and within hours of taking oath demanded India to remove its personnel from the strategically located archipelago in the Indian Ocean.
<br>
Edition.mv further reported that while the first troops to depart the country are the Indian military personnel operating the two helicopters in Addu City, the military personnel present in Haa Dhaalu atoll Hanimaadhoo and Laamu atoll Kahdhoo are also expected to leave ahead of May 10.

India's â‚¹ 771 Crore Boost To Maldives Amid Diplomatic Row: Report
India had agreed to remove their troops from Maldives under the condition that a number of their civilians equivalent to the military presence are brought to operate the aircraft.
<br>
The Opposition has been directing criticism at the administration asserting that the Indian personnel sent to Maldives as civilians are in reality military officials out of uniform and that the government has no way to ascertain otherwise, the portal claimed.
<br>
Meanwhile, local media reports also said that Maldives has successfully tied up with Sri Lanka to run flights for medical evacuation last week, further indicating that it is bent on removing all Indian troops in whichever category.
<br>
Further highlighting that securing true independence is a concept he regards with utmost priority, the President remarked that the State is exerting efforts with due importance "to regain the southern maritime area deprived of the country in addition to expelling Indian troops from the Maldives."
<br>
"I am confident we can achieve this. The delay in concluding this task is due to the adverse procedures practiced during the implementation. It was done without even taking the matter to the parliament ... in violation of the Constitution as well," the portal quoted the President as saying.
<br>
The Maldives' proximity to India, barely 70 nautical miles from the island of Minicoy in Lakshadweep and 300 nautical miles from the mainland's western coast, and its location at the hub of commercial sea lanes running through the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) gives it significant strategic importance.

The Maldives has been India's key maritime neighbour in the IOR and it occupies a special place in its initiatives such as SAGAR ( <i>Security and Growth for All in the Region</i> ) and the Neighbourhood First Policy.'

        <h1>Bengaluru water crisis: After gated communities, industrial areas bear the brunt</h1>

        <i>More Residents' Welfare Associations issue advisories on water rationing as private water tankers refuse to supply due to government crackdown; online petition demands uninterrupted water supply.</i>

        <p>CHRISTIN MATHEW PHILIP| MARCH 06, 2024 / 02:40 PM IST</p>
        <img src="./Media/Images/banglore water crises.avif" alt="" title="Bengaluru water crisis: After gated communities, industrial areas bear the brunt">
        <p><i>Bengaluru is currently grappling with one of its most severe water crises even before the peak of summer. According to BWSSB, the situation is manageable in core areas but critical in the city's outer regions, especially near tech corridors where there is no piped supply of water from the Cauvery River.</i></p>

        <p>Bengaluru is facing a steep water crisis as borewells in many areas of the city have dried up. The residents are dependent on water tankers for their daily chores which often charge exorbitant amounts.
            <br>

            <b>India Today TV</b> spoke to residents of RR Nagar who said they have to stand in long queues to get water.
            <br>
            
            "There is a water problem throughout Pattanagere in RR Nagar. There's no one to speak to us. If we take more than one pot, they (authorities) send us back," said Chikkalappa, a resident.
            
            </p>

            <p>"They won't even let children be with us. They ask who the child is. If we say it's our child, they send them back," she added.
                <br>

                Chikkalappa said there are six members in her family. "Water isn't enough. We have to adjust and manage," she said.
                <br>
                "I am 71 years old. I have to stand in a queue. I need to get water before children go to school," she said.
                <br>
                Another resident from Pattanagere said, "We don't have water for bathing, to give to our cows for drinking. We have one pot of water for the five of us. It's not enough."
                <br>
                "For cooking, we use corporation water. We filter the water and drink it, boil it and manage," the person said.
                <br>
                Divya, a resident of RR Nagar, said, "There is water scarcity for more than three months. Every day, we call <b>BWSSB</b> (Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board) engineer."</p>
